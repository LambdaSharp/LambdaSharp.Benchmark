# AWS Lambda Performance for C#, Python, and NodeJS

Various implementations of a simple Lambda function to test performance.

This is the outcome of a quick and dirty performance test performed on 2016-12-12 to compare the performance
of various AWS lambda engines.
All tests were done by sending the string `"foo"` as input to each respective function using the AWS console.
The test setup extremely simple: repeatedly keep clicking the `Test` button in the AWS Lambda console and select
a representative log statement.

The functions were deployed in `us-east-1` with their respective default settings.
The C# function was deployed using `dotnet lambda deploy-function`.
The Node and Python functions were deployed using the `HelloWorld` sample code for each respective language and
changing the implementation so a simple string would be accepted and converted to uppercase.
